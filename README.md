## 📊 **5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights**  
### 🔎 **5.1 Key Findings from Power BI Dashboards**  
📌 **University Departments Affecting Retention Rate:**  
🎓 **Liberal Arts & Sciences** has the highest retention and non-retention rate.  
⚙️ **Engineering & Business** show moderate retention but significant non-retention percentages.  
🏥 **Nursing, Fine Arts, and Pharmacy** exhibit lower retention rates.  

📌 **Retention Rate vs. Student Participation in Clubs:**  
❌ **Students who do not participate in clubs** have a higher dropout rate.  
✅ **Students spending 100% of their time in clubs** show a significantly higher retention rate.  
🟢 **Students with up to 75% club participation** have the **lowest dropout rates**.  

📌 **Retention Rate Based on Pell Grant:**  
💰 **Students without Pell Grants** have the highest dropout rates.  
🎓 **Students receiving Pell Grants for four semesters** show the highest retention.  
📢 **Financial aid plays a crucial role** in student retention.  

📌 **Retention Rate vs. Academic Confidence Rating:**  
📈 **Higher confidence ratings (3.0-4.0, 4.0-5.0)** correlate with **higher retention rates**.  
⚠️ **Students with lower academic confidence (below 3.0)** are at **higher risk of dropout**.
